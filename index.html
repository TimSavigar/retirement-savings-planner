        <h2>Why plan for retirement?</h2>
        <p>Starting early and contributing regularly can dramatically increase your retirement savings due to compound interest. Even small monthly contributions grow over time. Consider investing in diversified portfolios and reviewing your plan annually. This calculator provides a simple projection based on constant contributions and fixed growth, but actual investment returns vary.</p>

            <h2>Retirement Planning Fundamentals</h2>
            <p>Retirement planning is one of the most important financial decisions you'll make. Understanding the key concepts and strategies can help you build a secure financial future and achieve your retirement goals.</p>
            
            <h3>The Power of Compound Interest</h3>
            <p>Compound interest is often called "the eighth wonder of the world" because it allows your money to grow exponentially over time. When you earn returns on your investments, those returns generate their own returns, creating a snowball effect.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Key factors that amplify compound growth:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Time:</strong> The longer your money is invested, the more time it has to compound</li>
                <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Regular contributions, even small ones, add up significantly</li>
                <li><strong>Rate of return:</strong> Higher returns accelerate growth, but come with increased risk</li>
                <li><strong>Starting early:</strong> Beginning in your 20s vs. 30s can mean hundreds of thousands more in retirement</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Common Retirement Savings Vehicles</h3>
            <p><strong>Employer-Sponsored Plans:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>401(k) / 403(b):</strong> Tax-advantaged accounts with potential employer matching</li>
                <li><strong>Pension plans:</strong> Defined benefit plans (becoming less common)</li>
                <li><strong>Employee Stock Purchase Plans:</strong> Opportunities to buy company stock at a discount</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs):</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Traditional IRA:</strong> Tax-deductible contributions, taxed on withdrawal</li>
                <li><strong>Roth IRA:</strong> After-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals in retirement</li>
                <li><strong>SEP-IRA / Solo 401(k):</strong> For self-employed individuals</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Other Investment Options:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Taxable investment accounts:</strong> No contribution limits, but no tax advantages</li>
                <li><strong>Health Savings Accounts (HSAs):</strong> Triple tax advantage for healthcare costs</li>
                <li><strong>Real estate investments:</strong> Property can provide rental income and appreciation</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Contribution Strategies</h3>
            <p><strong>Maximise Employer Matching:</strong></p>
            <p>Always contribute enough to your employer's retirement plan to receive the full company match. This is essentially free money and an immediate return on your investment.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Dollar-Cost Averaging:</strong></p>
            <p>Investing a fixed amount regularly (monthly or bi-weekly) helps smooth out market volatility and can result in better average purchase prices over time.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Gradual Increases:</strong></p>
            <p>Increase your contribution percentage annually, especially when you receive raises. This helps you save more without feeling the impact on your current lifestyle.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Tax-Efficient Investing:</strong></p>
            <p>Consider the tax implications of different account types and investment strategies to maximise your after-tax returns.</p>
